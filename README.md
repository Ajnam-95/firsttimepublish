# firsttimepublish
I am learning how to use GitHub and this is my first step into publishing code. 

## What it does
This project does one thing and one thing only:
- It prints "Hello" followed by a string that would be the user's name.

Example:
say_hello("Bobby")
Output: Hello, Bobby

## To get started: 
1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Clone this repository or copy the code into a .py file.
3. Run the file and call say_hello() with your name as an argument.
